            <p>
                Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. 
                There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Errors, exceptions, and warnings</h4>
            <p>
                Errors are usually caused by one of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="defTitle">
                            System error
                        </span>
                         ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="defTitle">
                            Programmer error
                        </span>
                         ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <span class="defTitle">
                            User error 
                        </span>
                        ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.

                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>The importance of testing and debugging</h4>
            <p>
                Javascript is built to fail silently, which spares us the heart attacks associated with error and warning nottifcations
                 all over the place. However those who fail in silence aren't readily heard. You may mis something because the fail isn't in 
                 your face. It is our responsibiltity make sure exceptions are caught, and dealt with by rigorousily testing our code.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Strict mode</h4>
            <p>
                Strict mode makes it so more exceptions and  warnings are produced, as well as prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
                This is an effort to improve code quality 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally Liniting Tools can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors,
                 and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Debugging in the browser</h4>
            <p>
                Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as Object, Array, and Function 
                that can be used to create objects, arrays and functions instead of literals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="defTitle">Alert()</span>
                alert()stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of 
                variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be. This is why it makes sense that in my Tic-Tac-Toe code 
                the input wouldn't show up once the alert ran because it acts as a break point.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that 
                will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also 
                hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on 
                the 'play' button.


            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Error objects</h4> 
            <p>
                An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, 
                or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.
            </p>   
            <p>
                The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It 
                should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Exception handling</h4> 
            <p>
                When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. 
                This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors.  
            </p>   
            <p>
                We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.
            </p>

             
            <br>

            <h4>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h4> 
            <p>
                Acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from. An object's prototype object may also have a prototype object, 
                which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on, this is known as a prototype chain. 
            </p>   
            <p>
                The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It 
                should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add a test – Write a test case that describe the function completely. In order to make the test cases 
                        the developer must understand the features and requirements using user stories and use cases.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Run all the test cases and make sure that the new test case fails.

                            This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.

                        <span>
                            An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program 
                            to deal with the error.

                            A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. 
                            This means the program will continue to run after a warning.

                <h4>
                    Modular JavaScript
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files 
                    and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality. 
                </p>

                <h4>
                    MVC Frameworks
                </h4>
                <p>MVC separates an application into three distinct, independent components that interact with each other:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Models</h4>
                        <p>
                            Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting 
                            (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. I

                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Views</h4>
                        <p>
                            Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. 
                            In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms. 
                        </p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <h4>Controllers</h4>
                        <p>
                            Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user 
                            (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <span>
                            Package managers allow developers to download modules from a central repository. 
                            Apackageis just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as apackage.json 
                            file that contains information about the code in the package.
                         </span>

                        <span>
                            Many MVC frameworks use templating languages to insert dynamic data into the page. 
                            They can be whole web pages, but are often just partials — parts of a page. This means that the 
                            application can update part 
                            of the page without having to make a request to the server, saving an HTTP request. 
                        </span>
                    </li>
