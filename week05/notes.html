            <p>
                Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. 
                There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Function properties and methods</h4>
            <p>
                The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the value of this. 

            </p>
           

            <br>

            <h4>Pure Functions</h4>
            <p>
                A key aspect of functional programming is its use of pure functions. A pure function is a function that adheres to the following rules:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always return the same result.
                </li>
            </ol>
</div>

            <div class="space">
                <h3>Definitions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="defTitle">Higher-order</p>
                        <span>
                            Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both.

                             </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="defTitle">Currying</p>
                        <span>
                            Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions. 
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <p class="defTitle">Warnings</p>
                        <span>
                            A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. 
                            This means the program will continue to run after a warning. 
                         </span>
                    </li>

                 
                
                    
                </ul>
            </div>
