        <h3>Object Literals</h3>
        <p>An ojbect can be thought of as a box of labeled folders. Every useful object has a series of labels known as keys and values, 
            which are generally data that we care about all grouped together. 

        </p>
    
        <br>
        <p class="highlight">
            To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces.
            <br> const name_of_object = {};
        </p>
        <p>When accessing the property of a object you please a '.' after the name of the object, followed by the name of the property you want to specify.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>The RegExp Object</h3>
        <p>
            A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. 
            The search pattern can be used for text search and text to replace operations. 
            A regular expression can be a single character or a more complicated pattern. 
            Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.
            Regurlar Expressions are objects the have their own predetermined properties.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
           <p> 
               The <span class="defTitle">global</span> property makes the pattern return all matches. 
            By default, the pattern only looks for the first occurrence of a match. <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">ignoreCase</span> property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case sensitive <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">multiline</span> property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end of a line. <br>
           </p> 
        </div>

        
        <br>
        <h3>The Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>
            DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to 
            glide through the document. 
            <br>
            The DOM treats everything on a web page as a node. HTML tags, the text inside these tags, even the attributes of a tag are all nodes. <br>
            What happens is DOM allows us to access elements on a webpage, for example if we want to get a user's input and do something with it
             we could get the input by the id of that element with getElementById() for example.
        </p>
      
        <br>

        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>
            Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. 
            Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
           <p> 
               The <span class="defTitle">global</span> property makes the pattern return all matches. 
            By default, the pattern only looks for the first occurrence of a match. <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">ignoreCase</span> property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case sensitive <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">multiline</span> property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end of a line. <br>

        <h3>Food For Thought</h3>
        
        <p>
        Consider the following scenerio. We are building a game called Superhero Mashup. This game allows you to create the classic superhero characters,
        with the ability to assign them different superpowers. So let's say we mash up Hulk with Superman as you level up the mash powers become more speficic.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was thinking about how we could use objects and property to create these characters. So based on what I understand, I could create an object called "Character". 
        The properties of these characters would be something like: Name, Gender, Superpowers,Hair Color, and Profession. Essentially because each of these properties
        are predifined by us the creator, we could put the all in an array in the object. An example would be (I added a couple extra):</p>
        
        <p class="highlight">
            const character = {
                superName: ['Black Panther','Loki','Ironman', 'Black Widow', 'Hulk'],
                mashup: ['Antman','Captain America','Suri', 'Winter Soldier' ],
                gender: ['Male','Female'],
                hairColor: ['Brown','Red','Blond'],
                profession: ['Hunter','Healer','Tank', Shaman],
                weakness: ['Anger','Running out of Arrows','Loss of Hammer worthiness'],
                strengths:['Technology','Singing Lullabys','Opening magic portals'],
                superpower: ['Transform','Laser beam','cat like strength, 'kicking butt when you don't have powers'],
                heroEmerge() {
                    return 'Welcome back Big Guy';
                }
            };

            const myCharacter = { name: 'Hulk', mashup: 'Black Widow' };
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This is just the simple version of the game, arguable each of these properties could 
        be objects of their own to allow users to build even more complex characters. Doesn't this make the characters more reuseable? Particularly since these are 
        predifined custom characters. On second thought would it be better instead of having arrarys to have the object of character contain objects? Not 
        sure which would be more approriate. I am thinking it might depend on the use. For example superpower could be an object because if it has different properties like
        power-level, catchphrase, 
        </p>
