            <h2 class="notes">Forms- Chapter 8</h2>
            <p>Processing forms before they are sent to the server is becoming more and more common, 
                this is where Javascript plays a strong role.
    
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. This value can be changed 
                by a user entering information or interacting with the form’s interface (such as using a slider to increase or 
                decrease a value). The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.
            </p>
    
            <br>
    
            <p>
                If the form had the same name as any properties or methods of thedocument.formsobject, such as 'submit', for example, 
                that property or method would be referenced instead of the form element.

            <h2 class="notes">Chp12 - Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. 
                There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
            <p>
                When I use my juicer, I put the fruit into the machine, press the 'on' button and out comes the juice. 
                I haven’t a clue how it does it—only that it makes a very loud noise! 
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
            <p>
                My juicer isn't the only appliance I own that has an 'on' button, although the way the on button works is 
                slightly different for each appliance. My juicer also uses the same electrical outlet as other appliances in my kitchen. I can also place various types of fruit into it and it still juices them.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Inheritance</h4>
            <p>
                I’d really like the next model up from my juicer, as it can deal with more types of fruit and it’s a bit quieter. Even though it has these extra features, I’m sure that inside it uses many of 
                the same parts that my juicer has. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Class</h4>
            <p>
                A class is like a cookie cutter, thinking back to my Superhero game from last week, we could use a class to set the characteristics of 
                a hero. Then the player can build unique characters based on the same class.
            </p>
            <p>Syntax for a Class</p>
            <p class="highlight">
                class classname { <br>
                    <span class="tab">constructor(parameter) {</span> <br>
                        <span class="tab">this.classname = parameter;</span>
                       <br>
                    <span class="tab">}</span><br>
                  } <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as Object, Array, and Function 
                that can be used to create objects, arrays and functions instead of literals.
            </p>
            <p>By convention, the names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized, 
                which is the convention used for classes in class-based programming languages.
            </p>

            <h4>Prototype Property</h4> 
            <p>
                Acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from. An object's prototype object may also have a prototype object, 
                which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on, this is known as a prototype chain. 
            </p>   
            <p>
                The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It 
                should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class.
            </p>

                        <span>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves 
                          separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.

                            the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the 'on' button.

                <h4>
                    Modular JavaScript
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files 
                    and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality. 
                </p>

                <h4>
                    MVC Frameworks
                </h4>
                <p>MVC separates an application into three distinct, independent components that interact with each other:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Models</h4>
                        <p>
                            Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting 
                            (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. I

                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Views</h4>
                        <p>
                            Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. 
                            In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms. 
                        </p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <h4>Controllers</h4>
                        <p>
                            Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user 
                            (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <span>
                            Package managers allow developers to download modules from a central repository. 
                            Apackageis just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as apackage.json 
                            file that contains information about the code in the package.
                         </span>
                    </li>
                    <li><p class="defTitle">Libraries</p>
                        <span>
                            a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks.

                        <span>
                            Many MVC frameworks use templating languages to insert dynamic data into the page. 
                            They can be whole web pages, but are often just partials — parts of a page. This means that the 
                            application can update part 
                            of the page without having to make a request to the server, saving an HTTP request. 
                        </span>
                    </li>
