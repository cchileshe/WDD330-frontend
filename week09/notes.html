        <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
        <p>
            The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information 
            about the browser and computer screen.

        </p>
        <p>
            BOM allows performing actions to manipulate the browser window through BOM objects without affecting the contents of the page i.e. the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a browser environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object. 
            BOM objects used to manipulate the browser window are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location: window.location() contains information about the URL of the current page.</li>
            <li>Document: has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window. </li>
            <li>History: window.history can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session.</li>
            <li>Navigator: contains information about the browser being used</li>
            <li>Screen: window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These objects are children of the window object. The window object represents the browser window. So, 
            they can be used either with the prefix: window.object_name or without using the prefix object_name
        </p>
    
        <br>
      
        <div class="highlight">
           <p> 
               The <span class="defTitle"> window.confirm()</span>  method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog 
               that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the 
               user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel 
               <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">window.prompt()</span> method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message
             provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user 
             clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned
             <br>

            <span class="defTitle">Cookies</span> Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.

        <br>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. This means that a browser does not remember 
            anything from one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests. 
            <br>
            Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users.

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>
            The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.

            Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. 
            Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.

               The <span class="defTitle">global</span> property makes the pattern return all matches. 
            By default, the pattern only looks for the first occurrence of a match. <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">ignoreCase</span> property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case sensitive <br>

            The <span class="defTitle">multiline</span> property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end of a line. <br>

        <h3>Food For Thought</h3>
        
        <p>
        Consider the following scenerio. We are building a game called Superhero Mashup. This game allows you to create the classic superhero characters,
        with the ability to assign them different superpowers. So let's say we mash up Hulk with Superman as you level up the mash powers become more speficic.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was thinking about how we could use objects and property to create these characters. So based on what I understand, I could create an object called "Character". 
        The properties of these characters would be something like: Name, Gender, Superpowers,Hair Color, and Profession. Essentially because each of these properties
        are predifined by us the creator, we could put the all in an array in the object. An example would be (I added a couple extra):</p>
        
        <p class="highlight">
            const character = {
                superName: ['Black Panther','Loki','Ironman', 'Black Widow', 'Hulk'], <br>
                mashup: ['Antman','Captain America','Suri', 'Winter Soldier' ], <br>
                gender: ['Male','Female'], <br>
                hairColor: ['Brown','Red','Blond'], <br>
                profession: ['Hunter','Healer','Tank', Shaman], <br>
                weakness: ['Anger','Running out of Arrows','Loss of Hammer worthiness'], <br>
                strengths:['Technology','Singing Lullabys','Opening magic portals'], <br>
                superpower: ['Transform','Laser beam','cat like strength, 'kicking butt when you don't have powers'], <br>
                heroEmerge() {<br>
                    return 'Welcome back Big Guy';<br>
                } <br>
            }; <br>

            const myCharacter = { name: 'Hulk', mashup: 'Black Widow' }; <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This is just the simple version of the game, arguable each of these properties could 
        be objects of their own to allow users to build even more complex characters. Doesn't this make the characters more reuseable? Particularly since these are 
        predifined custom characters. On second thought would it be better instead of having arrarys to have the object of character contain objects? Not 
        sure which would be more approriate. I am thinking it might depend on the use. For example superpower could be an object because if it has different properties like
        power-level, catchphrase, 
        </p>
